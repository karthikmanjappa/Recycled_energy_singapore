#### Singapore has a new milestone of becoming a zero-waste nation as government is worried about the rising number of waste disposal.Singapore recycling energy is a key part of their sustainability strategy. The country has made significant strides in energy recovery and recycling, especially in waste-to-energy technologies. For instance, Singapore'swaste-to-energy plants, like the Tuas South Incineration Plant, convert waste into electricity, contributing to the country's energy mix and reducing landfill use.The government would like to motivate citizens by sharing the total energy that the combined recycling efforts have saved every year.
### Energy Saved ( Total Recycled Rate):

### Waste Data Generated to Recycled 2003 to 2017 & 2018 To 2020
#### This Visualization Show the clean_waste_18_20, clean_waste_03_17 year to Year Energy saved and By analyzing categorical waste type in our dataset and we can clearly see how the same category has different names.

### Energy saved per year: 
#### It's time to calculate energy saved every year from 2003 to 2020 based on five waste types, plastics, paper, glass, ferrous and non-ferrous metal.
#### Amount of Waste Recycled or Reused (in tons): The quantity of each waste type recycled or reused each year. Energy Savings Factors (in BTUs or kWh): The energy saved per ton of each waste type recycled or reused These factors vary based on the type of waste.

### Total Energy Saved In Last 5 years:
#### //Convert energy saved to GWh and format as string:
#### The numeric values are then divided by 1,000,000 to convert the energy saved to gigawatt-hours (GWh).
#### The resulting values are rounded to two decimal places, converted to strings, and appended with " GWh" to indicate the unit.

### Conclusion:
#### "Singapore's dedication to harnessing recycled energy showcases its forward-thinking approach to sustainability. By transforming waste into valuable energy, the nation not only addresses environmental challenges but also sets a global standard for urban resilience. As Singapore continues to innovate, its recycled energy initiatives will play a crucial role in achieving a greener and more sustainable future, inspiring other cities around the world to follow suit. the adoption of recycled energy technologies in Singapore has demonstrated significant potential in reducing environmental impact and promoting energy sustainability. Through initiatives such as waste-to-energy (WTE) plants and increased energy efficiency measures, Singapore has been able to offset substantial amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and reduce reliance on conventional energy sources. These efforts align with the nation’s vision of becoming a greener and more sustainable city, as outlined in the Singapore Green Plan 2030. However, continued innovation, public-private collaboration, and policy support are crucial to further scale recycled energy initiatives. By investing in such technologies, Singapore can not only meet its energy goals but also serve as a model for other cities seeking to adopt circular economy principles.
